# Work Day Planner


## Description

This day planner can help you manage your time each day. The planner allows you to add events or tasks for each hour of the standard business day. The task is saved so you don't need to worry about losing your schedule if you refresh the browser. The calendar is color coded to let you know what you've already done, what you should be doing now, and what you have remaining for the day.
